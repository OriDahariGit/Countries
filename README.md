# Countries Project

## About the Project
This project is a solution to an assignment I had during my participation in the fullstack developement club **[COLMAN's DevClub](#https://github.com/ColmanDevClubORG)**. It uses HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS, to build a modern looking web application that lets users read information about countries all over the world

The project calls [REST Countries](#https://restcountries.com/) API's various endpoints, to pull information about countries over HTTP calls.
