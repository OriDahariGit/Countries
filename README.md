# Countries Project

<p style="font-style:italic">Created on: November 2024</p>


## About the Project
This project is a solution to an assignment I had during my participation in the fullstack developement club <a href="https://github.com/ColmanDevClubORG">COLMAN's DevClub</a> It uses HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS, to build a modern looking web application that lets users read information about countries all over the world

The project calls <a href="https://restcountries.com/">REST Countries</a> API's various endpoints to pull information about countries over HTTP calls.
